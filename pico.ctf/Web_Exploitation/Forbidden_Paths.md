# What I did
So first, I played around with the website and tried to figure out how it works. I opened the oliver_twist.txt and then I tried doing cd /usr/share/nginx/html/ in the input area but that did not work. After that I just entered /usr/share/nginx/html/ to the input and I got Not Authorised as the response which was different from what I did before. It says that the website is filtering absolute file paths. I used a relative path as '../../../flag.txt' and it worked and I got the flag:
 picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}
