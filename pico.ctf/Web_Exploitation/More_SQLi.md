# What I did
Opened the website. I learnt about SQLi last week from a Youtuber named NetworkChuck. I tried this challenge and tried admin as user and hi as password at first and got this as the response:
```
username: admin
password: hi
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = 'hi' AND username = 'admin'
```
Then I put hi' OR 1=1;-- as the password and it worked.

I tried random stuff like 'select * from users' and all (i am rusty in SQL and will watch a YT video on SQL in general).
I got stuck here and used the hint which gave SQLiLite as the hint but I haven't progressed yet.
