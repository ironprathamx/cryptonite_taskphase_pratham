# What I did

I opened the website and started looking for buttons and places where I could enter input. I only found three ways to interact with the website directly, which was three buttons with "Detail" written on it. Then I played around in the Inspect tab and went through the source code and explored it a bit. I went to the networks tab and clicked on the Details button to see the new entries. This is around the time when I decided to see the hint which was 'XML external entity Injection
'. I knew that XML is a markup language and injection probably means injecting code into the back end and something like that. After that I went through inspect tabs again looking for the xml keyword. I found it in the Sources tab as follows:

After this, I went back to the network tab and this time, in the payload, I found this written:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>1</ID></data>
```

which had xml in it. This seemed like a more promising start to the problem than the one in sources tab. 
I went on youtube and watched several youtube videos on this topic:
1- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGDJ695dUEM&t=107s

After this, I downloaded Firefox as it is more flexible and allows users to edit payload before sending request, which isn't possible in the Chrome browser.
