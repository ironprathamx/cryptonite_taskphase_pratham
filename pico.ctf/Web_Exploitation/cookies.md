# What I did
Inspected the website, went to the network tab and I found this value in a cookie names session 'eyJfZmxhc2hlcyI6W3siIHQiOlsiZGFuZ2VyIiwiVGhhdCBkb2Vzbid0IGFwcGVhciB0byBiZSBhIHZhbGlkIGNvb2tpZS4iXX1dfQ'. I went to dcode.fr and found out that it was base64 encoded so I decoded it and got the following value:
{"_flashes":[{" t":["danger","That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie."]}]}
Then i kept trying things and exploring developer tools more and in applications, I found cookies again but nothing special there. Randomly I decided to enter values in the input thing. I first inputted cookies and then snickerdoodle as it was alr there. Then something changed and I got an updated website. Also the value of a cookie changed from -1 to 0. This is when I realised that I could change that value. I entered -1 again and it took me back to the initial page. Then I entered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then I just incremented it by 5 and got up to 28 as it couldn't be increased to a value more than that. Then I decided that the flag must be in one of the values. I kept trying and in value 18, I finally got the flag.
