# What I did
First I went through the source code and inspect tabs but found nothing. Then I tried opening:
http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/robots
It didn't work. Then I tried opening
http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/robots.txt
This worked and I got this in the link:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html

After that, I opened http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915/8028f.html where I got the flag.
