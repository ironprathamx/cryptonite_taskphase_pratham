# What I did
I found the first two parts of the flag with ease as they were both in the Sources tab. For the third part, I was given a hint:
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
I googled about this and found out that it was related to robots.txt. There was a font part called roboto/v32 and it confused me as I thought it was related to that. On getting nowhere, I added robots.txt to the end of the website and I got the third part of the flag. I got another hint for the next part:
 I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
 On googling, I found out that apache servers are open source. That means I can access its directories and all. On doing further research and trying several directories, /.htaccess worked and I got the fourth part of the flag. The next hint is:
I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
I got stuck here. 

Flag so far: picoCTF{th4ts_4_lt_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k
