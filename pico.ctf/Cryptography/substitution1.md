# What I did
I went to the dcode.fr website's mono alphabetic cipher and then decoded it. I got this as the flag: PICOCTF{FR3ZU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_7AA384BC}
However, there was a problem as it didn't work. 

Then I went through the weird crossword type of thing. I am not able to upload the screenshot rn but I basically went through all the alphabets and looked for the alphabet which had not been used once in the entire code. The Z in my code had to be replaced so I manually went through all the alphabets which could replace it and I first used Q and it worked. This manual way of going through all the options is probably not the omst efficient manner and I will look into how to do a frequency analysis or whatever I did manually on the computer.
