# What I did
So this one was very challenging for me. I haven't finished this chall but I feel like I have grasped the basic concept. I have to learn about inverse modulo. To reverse the code, I came up with this:
```
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"
chars="DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
out = ""
prev = 0
for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    original_index = (cur + prev) % 40
    out += lookup1[original_index]
    prev = original_index
print(out)
```
This gave me the output as:
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
Now the output makes sense so my initial code must be correct. But i don't understand what to do now and what to input. It does say self input but whats that supposed to mean? I will try this again.

Okay I got the flag:
