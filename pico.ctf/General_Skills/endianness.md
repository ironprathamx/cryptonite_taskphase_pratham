# What I did
I learnt about what little endian and big endian means. Little endian is the data from LSB to MSB and big endian is from MSB to LSB. In this challenge, we got a word and we had to write it in both little and big endian. So I first wrote the ASCII values of each letter in the word and converted it to hexadecimal. For little endian, I reversed the value and for big endian, I just entered all the hexadecimal values normally.
