# What I did
 To feed bob,
if (count > 2 * BUFSIZE) {
            serve_bob();
That means we have to feed Patric something that would have a size of over 64. That is only possible with Gr%114d_Cheese as it has a format specifier. Similarly, we server Bob Cla%sic_Che%s%steak as it has more format specifiers and we get the flag.
