# What I did
I downloaded the files. The c file had flagsize max defined as 64 so inputting a string with more than 64 characters would cause a buffer overflow. This write up isn't complete yet.
The terminal looked like this:
```
% nc saturn.picoctf.net 52537
Input: 172ye8281732132738832183121230823212831021303290u213u02310u210912
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```
