# What I did
I first went through the C code. I realised that safe_var needs to be made equal to pico. To do this, we use the concept of heap overflow.

I first learnt the addresses of pico and bico. bico here is the safe_var. The addresses are 0x56eec20962b0 and 0x56eec20962d0 and differ by 32 positions. So I need to add 32 characters and the 33th char will start overwriting safe_var. Therefore I added random 32 chars and then pico which updated the safe_var as we can see, thus giving us the flag. For this, I watched several videos on heaps and stacks.
