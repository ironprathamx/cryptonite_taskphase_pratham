# What I did
I downloaded the file, opened it and got the second half of the file. Then I opened my terminal and tried to open the file using cat but that didn't work. Then I entered the file command and realised that its a png file. My initial response made me open hex editor but then I realised that I can just change it from .pdf to .png and when I did that, I got the first part of the flag.
