# What I did
Tried using the file and exiftool command on the file but it didn't work although I found out that the file. was a BMP image. Then I added the extension to it but i couldn't see the image. I opened hex editor then and checked the header and footer. After making some changes and updates, I saved the file and then I was able to view it online and the image had the flag.
