# What I did
So in these challenges, we learn how to use SIEM tools that is Security Information and Event Management. Now I have been interested in this field for a very long time so I had an idea of what SIEM tools are as I learnt about them in a Cybersecurity course I did on Coursera. However this was my first time actually using them and I was really excited. SIEM tools make it very easy to see and understand how network traffics are working. These challenges would be pretty easy as it just requires filtering and basic stuff, however, I believe that this challenge is great for developing the thought process needed to analyse so much data. Some dude is bruteforcing us in this and when they succeed, they run some code in our system.

Here, I had some trouble with the second question but that was because I kept getting the time period wrong.
