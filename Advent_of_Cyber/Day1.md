# What I did
I just followed along and did all the steps. It was really cool as I was learning forensic type tools and learnt about exiftool. There are two files song.mp3 and somg.mp3. We check their properties using file file_name command. After that we further inspect somg.mp3 using exiftool after we find out that it is a link. exiftool allows us to realise that it runs a code from a github page. The github page has a comment "Created by the one and only MM". 
The link is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1
From here, we get the user MM-WarevilleTHM and we continue the investigation.

All of these answers can be found either in the Github pages by investigating further or in the powershell script or the response to exiftool.
