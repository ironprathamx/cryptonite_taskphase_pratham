# What I did
I learnt about YARA and how it identifies malwares. I also learnt about how malwares use base64 encoded strings to not be identified by YARA. We also learn about floss.exe. I am not very familiar with the Windows ecosystem and this was refreshing for me as I got experience with a new system.
